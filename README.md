Group 5 Real Estate Finder Project
### Introduction
Welcome to the Group 5 Real Estate Finder project! Our aim is to create an intuitive platform that simplifies the process of finding properties for investment, purchase, or rental purposes. With a user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, we strive to provide a seamless experience for both property seekers and investors.

## Project MVP
Homepage (Lewis)
The homepage serves as the gateway to our platform. It features a clean and organized layout with a header and footer that provide easy navigation throughout the site.

Search Page (Yvonne)
Our search page is designed to cater to the diverse needs of our users. It includes customizable fields where consumers can input their requirements such as area, budget, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property type, and more.

Search Results/Filter (Yvonne)
Upon entering their search criteria, users will be presented with a summary of properties that match their preferences. Key information and thumbnail photos will be displayed, allowing users to quickly evaluate their options.

Property Details Page (Joel)
For users interested in a particular property, the property details page offers a wealth of information. From high-quality pictures and detailed descriptions to features, location maps, contact information, and any other relevant details, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview to aid decision-making.

User Account Dashboard (Sydney)
Our user account dashboard empowers logged-in users to manage their profiles efficiently. They can update personal information, save searches, bookmark properties, and review their search history, all from one centralized location.

Navigation Bar & Project Management (Samuel)
Samuel is responsible for creating the navigation bar to ensure seamless navigation across different pages of our platform. Additionally, as the Scrum Master, he oversees project management tasks and facilitates effective communication within the team.
